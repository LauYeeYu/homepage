I believe, that every one in academia --- whatever gender, gender
identity, ethics, background, etc. --- should work together as a
whole, which is how "**#WeResearchAsOne**" initiates. Every gender,
ethics, or background should be respected and treated equally. Only
by collaborating well with each other, can we make great progress
in research.

In academia, there are still a lot of problems happening nowadays.
There are discrimination, harassment, and bullying --- that's why
I'm calling on every researcher to "research as one".

For example, women are the most vulnerable group in academia.
I heard a lot of cases when women were belittled, bullied, or even
sexually harassed. Another problem that seems to be less serious but
still important is disrespecting someone by ignoring their opinion,
or even worse, by stealing their idea. This can frustrate the person,
or even lead to worse consequences, e.g., depression. This is quite
common in sexual minority groups, e.g., LGBTQ+, because there are still
a lot of people who think they are abnormal and have a bad attitude
towards them.
Other problems includes belittling someone by yelling at them, or by
forcing them to only do boring work, e.g., administrative work and
repetitive work. This can make the person feel inferior to others,
and lose their confidence.

Alongside these problems, there are also some unprofessional behaviours.
The most simple one is a senior researcher pointing fingers at a junior
researcher. This can make the junior researcher feel under great pressure,
and eliminate their passion for research. Other problems includes romantic
relationships despite conflict of interest, for example, between a teaching
assistant and a student, advisor and advisee, or mentor and mentee. This
can lead to unfair treatment to other people. To make things worse, if the
relationship is ambiguous, it is really hard to tell whether it is a real
romantic relationship or not.

One of the reasons why these problems are still happening is the lack of
actual punishment. The
[Appendix A](#appendix-a-----obstacles-in-enforcing-punishment) lists the
obstacles in actually enforcing punishment that I thought of. If the
punishment is not served, the offender will still do the same thing again.

In my opinion, all people in academia, since they are all qualified to
be in academia, have the capability to work as a good researcher.
Therefore, they should not be blamed because they fail to meet the
expectation of others, as long as they make their best effort.
Any unfair treatment and unprofessional behaviour are not acceptable
and should be eliminated as soon as possible.

I always strongly support anyone who are belittled, discriminated,
harassed, treated unfairly, etc. I am committed to keep a supportive
environment in all labs where I work or have worked. I respect all
people, particularly the minority, because they have suffered much
greater emotional hardships. If I spot any cases when people
are disrespected, I will make every effort to address the problem, and
make the victim feel better. If direct action is not possible or brings
more harm, I will try to find a way to help the victim indirectly.
If necessary, I will transfer the case into written form, and report
them to the appropriate authorities.

I believe that if all people, regardless of their gender, gender
identity, ethics, background, etc., work together collectively and
collaboratively without discrimination and inequality, we can push
the boundary of human knowledge further and make greater achievements
for all people. Every researcher should join hands and support every single
person in academia to create a better world for all human beings!

## Appendix A --- Obstacles in Enforcing Punishment

The enforcement of punishment is the most important part in eliminating
or reducing the occurrence of unprofessional behaviour. Without punishment,
the policy is just a piece of paper. However, various obstacles exist
in enforcing punishment.

1. **Excessive protection on students (offenders).**
   Students are normally considered as the group that can be easily
   corrected. Therefore, the department might probably give a chance
   to the students and only warn them. This makes sense, but some
   students might regard their misconduct as minor and continue to
   do the same thing again.
2. **The reputation of universities and departments.**
   Universities and departments care about their reputation a lot. To
   avoid the negative impact on their reputation, they might try to
   cover up the case, or give a light punishment to the offender.
3. **Too severe punishment.**
   Admittedly, severe punishment will prevent people from doing these
   misconducts. However, if the punishment is too severe, it might
   backfire. The department might be afraid of ruining the offender's
   career, and choose not to enforce the punishment.
   **If the punishment can have a wider range**, according to
   the severity of the problem, these problems might be resolved. On
   the other hand, with the wider range of punishment, the punishment
   can be more reasonable and fair.
4. **The lack of evidence.**
   In some cases, the evidence is not enough to prove the misconduct.
   This makes it hard to enforce the punishment. To make things worse,
   some problem that is marginal is difficult to judge. For example,
   the ambiguous romantic relationship is hard to tell whether it
   breaches the policy or not.
5. **Relationship with the offender.**
   People might choose not to report the case because they
   are afraid of ruining the offender's relationship, or even worse,
   ruining their own career. This is particularly true when the
   offender is a close friend, or a person who has a great influence
   on the department.

I believe, that every one in academia --- whatever gender, gender
identity, ethics, background, etc. --- should work together as a
whole, which is how "**#WeResearchAsOne**" initiates. Every gender,
ethics, or background should be respected and treated equally. Only
by collaborating well with each other, can we make great progress
in research.

In academia, there are still a lot of problems happening nowadays.
There are discrimination, harassment, and bullying --- that's why
I'm calling on every researcher to "research as one".

For example, women are the most vulnerable group in academia.
I heard a lot of cases when women were belittled, bullied, or even
sexually harassed. Another problem that seems to be less serious but
still important is disrespecting someone by ignoring their opinion,
or even worse, by stealing their idea. This can frustrate the person,
or even lead to worse consequences, e.g., depression. This is quite
common in sexual minority groups, e.g., LGBTQ+, because there are still
a lot of people who think they are abnormal and have a bad attitude
towards them.

Other problems includes belittling someone by yelling at them, or by
forcing them to only do boring work, e.g., administrative work and
repetitive work. This can make the person feel inferior to others,
and lose their confidence.

In my opinion, all people in academia, since they are all qualified to
be in academia, have the capability to work as a good researcher.
Therefore, they should not be blamed because they fail to meet the
expectation of others, as long as they make their best effort.

I always strongly support anyone who are belittled, discriminated,
harassed, treated unfairly, etc. I am committed to keep a supportive
environment in all labs where I work or have worked. I respect all
people, including the minority. If I spot any cases when people
are disrespected, I will make every effort to address the problem, and
make the victim feel better. If direct action is not possible or brings
more harm, I will try to find a way to help the victim indirectly.
If necessary, I will transfer the case into written form, and report
them to the appropriate authorities.

I believe that if all forks, regardless of their gender, gender
identity, ethics, background, etc., work together collectively and
collaboratively without discrimination and inequality, we can push
the boundary of human knowledge further and make greater achievements
for all people. Every researcher should join hands and support every single
person in academia to create a better world for all human beings!
